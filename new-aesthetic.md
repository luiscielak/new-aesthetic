<!-- 
    Research the theory: 
        - What it is, 
        - where it came from, 
        - find 2+ other people who have written about that theory.
        - Find 3 concrete examples of that theory in practice.

1. Look around once in a while.

2. Think about the things that you think about.

3. Wonder what if, and how come often.

## Description

The New Aesthetic is a termed coined by James Bridle to describe the blending of the virtual and physical worlds. 

The New Aesthetic is about the orchestration of pixels and bricks in the same plane.


<!--  

The New Aesthetic is a term used to refer to the increasing appearance of the visual language of digital technology and the Internet in the physical world, and the blending of virtual and physical. 

The phenomenon has been around for a long time but lately James Bridle and partners have surfaced the notion through a series of talks and observations. 

The term gained wider attention following a panel at the SXSW conference in 2012. [#sxaesthetic][1]

<!--  
One of the core themes of the New Aesthetic has been our collaboration with technology, whether that’s bots, digital cameras or satellites (and whether that collaboration is conscious or unconscious), and a useful visual shorthand for that collaboration has been glitchy and pixelated imagery, a way of seeing that seems to reveal a blurring between “the real” and “the digital”, the physical and the virtual, the human and the machine. It should also be clear that this ‘look’ is a metaphor for understanding and communicating the experience of a world in which the New Aesthetic is increasingly pervasive. [#sxaesthetic][1]

<!-- Beauty -->

What is beauty? What is art? 

<!-- New, modern, contemporary -->

<!-- What is new? What is the present? What is the future? What is the past? -->

The past is needed in order to be able to contextualize the present. The present is only meaningful until we think of the future -- looking ahead allows us to drift through the present with a unwritten promises of a better and more rewarding future. 

It is only after we have lived the past, that we can see the present in constant change. Previous experiences are the only proof of existence that we have.

## People


### James Bridle



### Marius Watz


Marius Watz is Norway born, New York City based generative art artist. Generative Art is referred to computer-generated art based on parametric instructions or algorithms to produce aesthetic forms as output.

<!-- { ideology : algorithm police } -->

Marius makes art based on parametric systems. 

"Algorithms provide the means to produce specific outcomes, typically through generative logic or data processing. But in the process they leave their distinct footprint on the result."

These common algorithms are a path to exploration and experimentation. The output of these self-discoveries of the algorithm and the process should not equate to the artist's output. 

The 'Algorithm Police' problematic friends:
- Circle packing
- Reaction diffusion
- Fractals
- Strange attractors
- Voronoi diagrams
- Flocking / boids
- Polygon subdivision

## Examples 

#### Art

<!-- @ideas : GIF art,  -->

#### Design

#### Architecture


<!-- "Some architects can look at a building and tell you which version of autodesk was used to create it." 

The world is defined by our visualisations of it. (Someone who makes such things told me: what they put in, even as place-holders, always ends up getting built. Lorem Ipsum architecture.) [#sxaesthetic][1]

#### Quotes

> You do not need to leave your room. Remain sitting at your table and listen. Do not even listen, simply wait, be quiet, still and solitary. The world will freely offer itself to you to be unmasked, it has no choice, it will roll in ecstasy at your feet.

>> Franz Kafka
