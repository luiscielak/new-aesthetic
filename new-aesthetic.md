<!-- 
    Research the theory: 
        - What it is, 
        - where it came from, 
        - find 2+ other people who have written about that theory.
        - Find 3 concrete examples of that theory in practice.

1. Look around once in a while.

2. Think about the things that you think about.

3. Wonder what if, and how come.

## Description

The New Aesthetic is a termed coined by James Bridle to describe the blending of the virtual and physical worlds. The New Aesthetic is about the orchestration of pixels and bricks in the same plane. The New Aesthetic is a term used to refer to the increasing appearance of the visual language of digital technology and the Internet in the physical world. "The New Aesthetic makes sense of its objects, forms and artifacts. It is an attempt to expand our perspective on what the New Aesthetic might mean, and also consider how media art can re-imagine itself by asking some difficult new questions." [3]

James Bridle introduced the term on May 6th, 2011. "For a while now, I've been collecting images and things that seem to approach a New Aesthetic of the future [...] we've got frustrated with the NASA extropianism space-future, the failure of jet-packs, and we need to see the technologies we actually have with a new wonder. Consider this a mood-board for unknown products." [3] Referencing to his Tumblr blog new-aesthetic.tumblr.com, where Bridle has been collecting the New Aesthetic artifacts that cross his path. [9] 

In March 15, 2012, James Bridle put together a panel at SXSW to explore topics on pixelation of low-resolution images, 3D printing, and digital maps. In this session, the participants explore the effects of the new media, products and artworks, and discuss the ways in which ways of seeing are increasingly transforming ways of making and doing. [10] The term gained wider attention following a panel at the SXSW conference in 2012. [1]

"For so long we've stared up at space in wonder, but with cheap satellite imagery and cameras on kites and RC helicopters, we're looking at the ground with new eyes, to see structures and infrastructures." [7] "The socio-political asymmetries perpetuated by data-mining, the privatized social graph, facial recognition technologies, drone attacks, and camouflage are swept aside by the positive message to make the world "more exciting, make it better." [8]


    
<!--  
One of the core themes of the New Aesthetic has been our collaboration with technology, whether that’s bots, digital cameras or satellites (and whether that collaboration is conscious or unconscious), and a useful visual shorthand for that collaboration has been glitchy and pixelated imagery, a way of seeing that seems to reveal a blurring between “the real” and “the digital”, the physical and the virtual, the human and the machine. It should also be clear that this ‘look’ is a metaphor for understanding and communicating the experience of a world in which the New Aesthetic is increasingly pervasive. [#sxaesthetic][1]

<!-- Beauty -->

What is beauty? What is art? 

<!-- New, modern, contemporary -->

<!-- What is new? What is the present? What is the future? What is the past? -->

The past is needed in order to be able to contextualize the present. The present is only meaningful until we think of the future -- looking ahead allows us to drift through the present with a unwritten promises of a better and more rewarding future. 

It is only after we have lived the past, that we can see the present in constant change. Previous experiences are the only proof of existence that we have.

## People


### James Bridle



### Marius Watz


Marius Watz is Norway born, New York City based generative art artist. Generative art is referred to computer-generated art based on parametric instructions or algorithms to produce aesthetic forms as output.

<!-- { ideology : algorithm police } -->

Marius makes art based on parametric systems. 

"Algorithms provide the means to produce specific outcomes, typically through generative logic or data processing. But in the process they leave their distinct footprint on the result."

These common algorithms are a path to exploration and experimentation. The output of these self-discoveries of the algorithm and the process should not equate to the artist's final output or masterpiece. 

The 'Algorithm Police' problematic friends:

    - Circle packing
    - Reaction diffusion
    - Fractals
    - Strange attractors
    - Voronoi diagrams
    - Flocking / boids
    - Polygon subdivision

<!-- { current work / projects } -->
Some of Marius' current work include 'Probability Lattice'. Parametric objects, dimensions variable (typically 14x14x14 cm). ABS plastic, 3D printed on a Makerbot Replicator.

## Examples 

#### Art

<!-- @ideas : GIF art,  -->

#### Design

#### Architecture

Our tools should not limit our ability to capture reality or the ability to create new ones. The tools that we use should not have such an imprint on the outcome of an artistic process. 

<!-- "Some architects can look at a building and tell you which version of autodesk was used to create it." 

The world is defined by our visualisations of it. (Someone who makes such things told me: what they put in, even as place-holders, always ends up getting built. Lorem Ipsum architecture.) [#sxaesthetic][1]

#### Fashion

<!-- Serena Williams uniform + processing -->

<!-- nervous systems + @shashasha -->


#### Business

<!-- Chipotle PR + 'Lorem Ipsum bag' -->
Chipotle PR team utilized the standard 'Lorem Impsum' text used by print and design professional as a placeholder in the production-version brown 'to-go' lunch bags. This manifestation of what it used to exists only in a digital world is also being spread by trendy marketing campaigns aiming to target *new* tech-savvy crowds.

#### Quotes

> You do not need to leave your room. Remain sitting at your table and listen. Do not even listen, simply wait, be quiet, still and solitary. The world will freely offer itself to you to be unmasked, it has no choice, it will roll in ecstasy at your feet.

>> Franz Kafka



> It's 2011, and I have no idea what anything is or does anymore.

>> Taylor, in Bridle 2011 [3]
