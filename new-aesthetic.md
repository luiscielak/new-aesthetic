## The New Aesthetic
## by Luis Cielak


## The Theory

 The New Aesthetic is a term used to refer to the increasing appearance of the visual language of digital technology and the Internet in the physical world, and the blending of virtual and physical. 

 The phenomenon has been around for a long time but lately James Bridle and partners have surfaced the notion through a series of talks and observations. 

 The term gained wider attention following a panel at the SXSW conference in 2012.[1]


> "You do not need to leave your room. Remain sitting at your table and listen. 
> Do not even listen, simply wait, be quiet, still and solitary. The world will 
> freely offer itself to you to be unmasked, it has no choice, it will roll in 
> ecstasy at your feet."
>> - Franz Kafka

## Why?

- Makes me see the world different
- Makes me think of the world different
- Makes me experience my life differently
- Makes me feel different 



### In Architecture

"Some architects can look at a building and tell you which version of autodesk was used to create it." 

The world is defined by our visualisations of it. (Someone who makes such things told me: what they put in, even as place-holders, always ends up getting built. Lorem Ipsum architecture.) [1]

 One of the core themes of the New Aesthetic has been our collaboration with technology, whether that’s bots, digital cameras or satellites (and whether that collaboration is conscious or unconscious), and a useful visual shorthand for that collaboration has been glitchy and pixelated imagery, a way of seeing that seems to reveal a blurring between “the real” and “the digital”, the physical and the virtual, the human and the machine. It should also be clear that this ‘look’ is a metaphor for understanding and communicating the experience of a world in which the New Aesthetic is increasingly pervasive.
