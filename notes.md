<!--  
One of the core themes of the New Aesthetic has been our collaboration with technology, whether that’s bots, digital cameras or satellites (and whether that collaboration is conscious or unconscious), and a useful visual shorthand for that collaboration has been glitchy and pixelated imagery, a way of seeing that seems to reveal a blurring between “the real” and “the digital”, the physical and the virtual, the human and the machine. It should also be clear that this ‘look’ is a metaphor for understanding and communicating the experience of a world in which the New Aesthetic is increasingly pervasive. [#sxaesthetic][1]

New' is both trendy and trending, 'new' is youthful, 'new' surprises us, 'new' is the varnish elaborately used to shine up that what is already there, what has been lying around in the bottom of the drawer collecting dust and what no one paid attention to... until it becomes the latest 'new' thing.

The technological properties that are foregrounded in the image are those that can be discerned on a surface level; the technologies related to its graphical iteration are not those that concern its creation.

Putting Fuller's quote into context, he seems to support the idea that assembling something out of parts that 'belong to a collectively available resource' provides a more or less direct lineage from the earliest Dadaists collage art, to net art, to surf clubs, to Tumblr, and to Pinterest. Fuller's assertion is that this kind of online bricolage brings us out of 'standard issue art modes' confronts the perennial battle between low and high culture, i.e., between the talented artists and the hopeless amateurs, since anyone can access the collective resource online, appropriate things, remix them and start collections.

The Algorithm Thought Police'

Are not neutral vessels. Algorithms provide the means to produce specific outcomes, typically through generative logic or data processing. But in the process they leave their distinct footprints on the result. […] “speaking” through algorithms, your thought patterns and modes of expression are shaped by their syntax. (Watz 2012a)

increasingly ubiquitous texture of reality, a skin that's being overlaid in buildings, fashion, cars, jewelry, print publications, and chairs.

Watz's affectionate term, would include, among many others: Circle Packing (which define an area in circles progressively without letting them enter in contact, until the area is completely covered), Polygon subdivision (different techniques of splitting an area in polygonal shapes) and boids (the simulations of the behavior of birds flocking); or voronoi, which is "the partitioning of a plane with n points into convex polygons such that each polygon contains exactly one generating point and every point in a given polygon is closer to its generating point than to any other"

Marius Watz, writing on the Creator's Project in a series of responses to Sterling’s essay, argued the case that this aspect was deceptive, "most of what NA offers up for examination is not all that new. Technologies like machine vision and geo-location are old by most standards” (2012b). In his reading, a sense of everyday practices and the ubiquity of digital and networked systems were claimed as distinctive instead: “what is new is their integration into our lives to the point where we are bringing them to bed” (2012b).

It may be, that after a long generation of 'New Media,' 'computer art,' 'digital art,' 'device art,' 'net.art,' 'code art,' and similar always-new pseudonyms, we’ve found a better perspective. We’ve paid a bill in blood and struggle, and a generational shift has occurred. It’s like watching a generation slog it out in the muddy barbed wire, and then seeing a drone appear overhead ... The barbed-wire and bayonet era of net-art is over. It is one with Ypres and Verdun now, and its trenches will fill in with grass. It will never return. (Sterling 2012c)

Rahel Aima and Madeline Ashby, respectively writer and futurist gave a basic instruction in 70's psychoanalytic feminist screen theory. In her blog post at The State, entitled 'Curation, Gender and the New Aesthetic', Aima awkwardly suggested that the attraction of the New Aesthetic might lie in the possibility to "briefly inhabit a (conventionally) feminised subjectivity?" (2012b). In her words,

The New Aesthetic is about being looked at by humans and by machines — by drones, surveillance cameras, people tagging you on Facebook — about being the object of the gaze. It's about looking through the eyes of a machine and seeing the machine turn its beady LEDs on you. It's about the dissolution of privacy and reproductive rights, and the monitoring, mapping, and surveillance of the (re)gendered (re)racialised body, and building our own super-pervasive panopticon. (Aima 2012)

<!-- ## Criticism -->

<!-- 
Honor Harger captured a sense of the more tragic outcomes of the debate with some sober reflections. She highlighted, in particular, her dismay at the extreme reactions to Bridle's Tumblr, especially the 'sneering insults' of his work. By contrast, she insists, that this project was never a 'movement', but a personal project. It was never concerned with media art practice, and judging it within those terms is at best 'pointless', at worst, 'unfair',

Ten Digital Readymades, however, and the link it sets up between Duchamp and process, is how computation actually serves to reinvigorate our understanding of the radical aspects of the readymade concept.

<!-- 
MTAA's Ten Digital Readymades (2000), created by entering the term 'ready made' into a search engine and archiving those search results, exemplified the sense that material on the web offers rich fodder for artists to develop work, with or without heavy subsequent alteration by artists (Kasprzak 2009).

Perhaps an exhibition like The Power of Things was difficult to read as critical, because a critical exhibition - in traditional electronic art terms - typically entails a bunch of computer screens and robotic sculptures in a dark industrial space, brought together under a dystopian scenario serving as an exhibition theme. Such classic ‘critical’ electronic art exhibitions, however, inform an antiquated interactive electronic art aesthetic - one that dictates that critically looking at technology’s impact on our world is best achieved by displaying hardware at work, and dispensing with frivolous topics such as beauty. Critical art, however, is also a question of sense and perception, of transformative forms and diagrams. The approach of The Power of Things explored relations between different materials in the world. This involved an aesthetics aimed at generating new hybrid or more-than-human collectives.

Manovich infamously referred to this as the difference between 'Turing-land' and 'Duchamp-land' (Manovich, 1996). Curator Catherine David expressed the Duchamp-land view in an early statement when she suggested "technology in itself is not a category according to which I judge works. This type of categorization is just as outmoded as division into classical art genres (painting, sculpture…). I am interested in the idea of a project; ideally the means of realizing the project should arise from the idea itself" (1997).
